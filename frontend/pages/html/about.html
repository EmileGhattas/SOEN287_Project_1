    <h1>About LearnSpace</h1>
    <section class="intro">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            LearnSpace was founded in 2023 with a simple idea: to make learning environments more accessible, organized,
            and collaborative. What began as a small campus project quickly grew into a platform connecting students,
            educators, and researchers to fully equipped rooms, advanced laboratories, and specialized tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            We realized that valuable time was being lost managing physical resources, booking lab space, reserving
            equipment, or scheduling group study rooms. LearnSpace was built to change that. Today, our system helps
            institutions streamline resource management while ensuring accessible, efficient, and safe access for everyone.
        </p>

    <section class="mission">

            At LearnSpace, our mission is to empower education and innovation through accessibility.
            We aim to eliminate scheduling conflicts, improve lab and equipment usage, and foster
            collaboration in academic and research settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you're booking a study room, reserving lab time, or checking out technical equipment,
            LearnSpace ensures the process is smooth, transparent, and reliable.
